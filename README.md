# YearCompass MD-edition
New year's resolutions don't work. YearCompass does.

## What is this?

It’s a YearCompass — your very own YearCompass, to be exact.

It is a instrument that helps you reflect on the past year and plan the next one. With a set of carefully selected questions and exercises, YearCompass helps you uncover your patterns and design a great year for yourself.

It has two distinct parts. The first half will help you review, learn from, and
celebrate the year you’re leaving behind. The second half, on the other hand, is all about the future. You’ll be dreaming, planning, and preparing to get the most out of the new year.

## What do i need to fill out this?

A few hours of uninterrupted focus, and an open and honest mind.

## Get ready

Arrive. Prepare your tools and the space around you. Close your eyes and take five deep breaths. Let go of your expectations. Start when you feel ready.
